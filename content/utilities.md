#### The following are some services that I provide for your convenience.

The mempool is where transactions live while waiting to be confirmed. Using the provided mempool explorer will allow you to see the congestion in the network, and get a recommendation on what to set your fees to when sending a transaction.

Remember it's up to you to determine how much of a hurry you are in! If you are willing to wait, you can send transactions very inexpensively.

{{< figure src="/images/explorer.png" class="w-75 center" link="https://btc.betterthan.gold" title="Bitcoin Block Explorer" >}}

A Bitcoin block explorer allows you to view information about the state of the bitcoin network, as well as view transactions and address details.

You can look up your own transactions here, and my node will verify that it knows about them and that they have actually occurred as expected.

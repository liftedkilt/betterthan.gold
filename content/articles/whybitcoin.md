We're on the brink of the largest technological change in money the world has ever seen. Bitcoin isn't just a **good** idea — It's the discovery of digital scarcity.

### Bitcoin is the best money we have ever had.

Bitcoin is better than fiat at transferring value across space. It takes weeks for dollars to finally settle between banks. Bitcoin settles every ten minutes, and instantly over some second layer solutions like the Lightning network.

It is better than gold at preserving value across time because it's perfectly scarce. Gold is mined out of the earth at a rate of 1-3% of the total supply annually. For any normal good, supply increases to meet demand. Bitcoin is the first monetary good that resists that supply inflation. This makes it the best vessel to store value in across time.

Bitcoin has a very unique property that differentiates it from anything else humans have ever experienced — programatic scarcity. Regardless of the demand for it, the incoming supply is unaffected. Every four years the amount of new bitcoin being mined is reduced in half.

This reduction in supply results in a massive liquidity crisis, which precedes a predictable run up in price every 4 years.

There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. If supply is fixed, and demand is increasing, price **must** rise to meet it.

You don't have to exchange your dollars for bitcoin. Nobody is forcing you to. But your dollars are like an ice cube, melting under the blistering sun of an ever increasing supply of dollars from the federal reserve. You have the opportunity to take bold action, and to alter the outcome of your family's financial future for generations to come.

Are you willing to put in the time it will require to wrap your head around this? *You don't have to.*

But if you don't, you will have to explain to your children why you were too apathetic and lazy to understand what was happening in front of your own eyes.

#### If you choose to go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, there's no going back.

Bitcoin isn&rsquo;t just a <strong>good</strong> idea — It&rsquo;s the discovery of digital scarcity.</p>
<h2 id="money-is-technology">Money is Technology</h2>
<p>Money is a technology for preserving the rewards of our labor across time
and transferring them across space. Gold was optimized for preserving
across time, fiat currencies are optimized for transferring across space.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the best form of money we have ever had.</p>
<p>It is better than gold at preserving value across time because it&rsquo;s perfectly scarce whereas the supply of gold is constantly growing by 1-3% a year.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is better than fiat at transferring value across space. It takes weeks for dollars to finally settle between banks. Bitcoin settles every ten minutes, and instantly over some second layer solutions like the Lightning network.</p>
<p>With everything else in this world, if the demand increases, supply will rise to meet it. If gold rises in price, gold miners dig faster to increase supply.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin is different.</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin has a very unique property that differentiates it from anything else humans have ever experienced — programatic scarcity.
Regardless of the demand for it, the incoming supply is constant, except for every 4 years where the incoming supply is cut in half.</p>
<p>This results in a predictable run up in price every 4 years.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/s2f.png"
         alt="The jump up in the white line represents the predicted jump after the supply decrease of the halving."/> <figcaption>
            <p><em>The jump up in the white line represents the predicted jump after the supply decrease of the halving.</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin, regardless of the demand. What is the implication of that? If supply is fixed, and demand is increasing, price <strong>must</strong> rise to meet it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to exchange your dollars for bitcoin. Nobody is forcing you to. But your dollars are like an ice cube, melting under the blistering sun of an ever increasing supply of dollars from the federal reserve. You have the opportunity to take bold action, and to alter the outcome of your family&rsquo;s financial future for generations to come.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/m2money.png"
         alt="This is the supply of US dollars. What happened in 2020?"/> <figcaption>
            <p><em>This is the supply of US dollars. What happened in 2020?</em></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Are you willing to put in the time it will require to wrap your head around this? <em>You don&rsquo;t have to.</em></p>
<p>But if you don&rsquo;t, you will have to explain to your children why you were to apathetic and lazy to understand what was happening in front of your own eyes.</p>

Central banks, the modern-era masters of money, wield this tool as a weapon to steal time and inflict wealth inequality.

As the temptation to manipulate money has always proven to be too strong for mankind to resist, the only antidote for this poison is an incorruptible money — Bitcoin.</p>
